My second webpage built using bootstrap and css

I built an online shopping page with products on display. Key features:

* nav bar with logo and links (not functional yet)
* 10 items on the page
* uses grid system and responsive design to resize based on browser/system on which it is viewed
* contains responsive images
* displays name and price for each product
* button to 'buy' the product (that links to the relevant shop website)
* horizontal form
* footer to get contact details of the customer
* company logo
